abstract = {An in vivo study was conducted to assess the sensitivity of fibrous capsule thickness and macrophage density to polymer fiber diameter. Single polypropylene fibers of diameters ranging from 2.1 to 26.7 microm were implanted in the subcutaneous dorsum of Sprague-Dawley rats. Results at 5 weeks demonstrated reduced fibrous capsule thickness for small fibers. Capsule thickness was 0.6 (+/-1.8) microm, 11.7 (+/-12.0) microm, 20.3 (+/-11.6) microm, and 25.5 (+/-10.0) microm for fibers in the ranges of 2.1 to 5.9, 6.5 to 10.6, 11.1 to 15.8, and 16.7 to 26.7 microm, respectively. Fibers very near to blood vessels had smaller capsules than did those with local vasculature further away. The macrophage density in tissue with fiber diameters 2.1 to 5.9 microm (23.03 +/- 8.67{\%}) was comparable to that of unoperated contralateral control skin (18.72+/-10.06{\%}). For fibers with diameters in the ranges of 6.5 to 10.6, 11.1 to 15.8, and 16.7 to 26.7 microm, macrophage densities were 33.90+/-13.08{\%}, 34.40+/-15.77{\%}, and 41.68+/-13.98{\%}, respectively, all of which were significantly larger (p{\textless}0.002) than that for the control. The reduced fibrous capsule thickness and macrophage density for small fibers ({\textless}6 microm) compared with large fibers could be due to the reduced cell-material contact surface area or to a curvature threshold effect that triggers cell signaling. A next step will be to extend the analysis to meshes to evaluate fiber-spacing effects on small-fiber biomaterials.},

abstract = {Fibrous materials have the potential of being used for tissue scaffolding. The interaction of macrophages with fibres of various compositions and sizes was observed in vitro. The following materials were tested: individual gold fibres; woven fibres of polyester and nylon; non-woven fibres of polybutylene/polypropylene 80:20 and polyester. All fibres had diameters between 2 and 40 $\mu$m. At the end of the 24 h incubation time, culture media were retrieved for the assay of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), two cytokines secreted by activated macrophages. Fibre samples were processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), or for immunofluorescence labelling of the MAC-1 and ICAM-1 cell surface markers. Confocal microscopy was used for the latter, which was performed with the woven and non-woven samples. None of the fibre samples induced significant amounts of TNF-$\alpha$ or IL-6 secretion in the culture medium, suggesting that the cells did not activate this pathway. SEM on individual gold fibres showed that the fibre diameter had an effect on the morphology of the cells, namely on their extent of spreading. Larger fibres had a higher number of cells, which tended to cluster together without spreading extensively. When comparing woven and non-woven fibres, SEM showed that cells spread extensively on the woven fibres, whereas they tended to maintain their spherical shape on the non-woven fibres. Confocal microscopy demonstrated a difference between materials in the number of MAC-1 and ICAM-1 positive cells. These results demonstrate that a combination of morphological, immune and biochemical markers can be used to distinguish the response of elicited macrophages to various materials. The cells appeared to be only moderately activated on all materials tested, with changes in their morphology but without increased secretion of cytokines. The measured responses imply interactions between nominal fibre composition and fibre diameter.},

abstract = {In the mammalian nervous system, billions of neurons connected by quadrillions of synapses exchange electrical, chemical and mechanical signals. Disruptions to this network manifest as neurological or psychiatric conditions. Despite decades of neuroscience research, our ability to treat or even to understand these conditions is limited by the capability of tools to probe the signalling complexity of the nervous system. Although orders of magnitude smaller and computationally faster than neurons, conventional substrate-bound electronics do not recapitulate the chemical and mechanical properties of neural tissue. This mismatch results in a foreign-body response and the encapsulation of devices by glial scars, suggesting that the design of an interface between the nervous system and a synthetic sensor requires additional materials innovation. Advances in genetic tools for manipulating neural activity have fuelled the demand for devices that are capable of simultaneously recording and controlling individual neurons at unprecedented scales. Recently, flexible organic electronics and bio- and nanomaterials have been developed for multifunctional and minimally invasive probes for long-term interaction with the nervous system. In this Review, we discuss the design lessons from the quarter-century-old field of neural engineering, highlight recent materials-driven progress in neural probes and look at emergent directions inspired by the principles of neural transduction.},

abstract = {Most preparations for making neural recordings degrade over time and eventually fail due to insertion trauma and reactive tissue response. The magnitudes of these responses are thought to be related to the electrode size (specifically, the cross-sectional area) and the relative stiffness of the electrode material. Carbon fiber ultra-microelectrodes have a much smaller cross-section than traditional electrodes and thus may enable improved longevity of neural recordings in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Only two carbon fiber array designs have been described previously, each with limited channel densities due to limitations of the fabrication processes or interconnect strategies. Here, we describe a method for assembling carbon fiber electrodes on a flexible polyimide substrate that will facilitate the construction of high-density recording and stimulating arrays for acute use in peripheral nerves. Fibers were aligned using an alignment tool that was 3D-printed with sub-micron resolution using direct laser writing. Indium deposition on the carbon fibers provided a robust and reliable method of electrical connection to the polyimide traces. Spontaneous action potentials and stimulation-evoked compound responses with SNR {\&}gt; 10 and {\&}gt; 120, respectively, were recorded from a small (125 $\mu$m) peripheral nerve. We also improved the typically poor charge injection capacity of small diameter carbon fibers can be improved by electrodepositing 100 nm thick iridium oxide films, making the carbon fiber arrays suitable for electrical stimulation as well as recording.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Individual carbon fiber microelectrodes can record unit activity in both acute and semi-chronic (∼1 month) implants. Additionally, new methods have been developed to insert a 16 channel array of carbon fiber microelectrodes. Before assessing the in vivo long-term viability of these arrays, accelerated soak tests were carried out to determine the most stable site coating material. Next, a multi-animal, multi-month, chronic implantation study was carried out with carbon fiber microelectrode arrays and silicon electrodes. APPROACH Carbon fibers were first functionalized with one of two different formulations of PEDOT and subjected to accelerated aging in a heated water bath. After determining the best PEDOT formula to use, carbon fiber arrays were chronically implanted in rat motor cortex. Some rodents were also implanted with a single silicon electrode, while others received both. At the end of the study a subset of animals were perfused and the brain tissue sliced. Tissue sections were stained for astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. The local reactive responses were assessed using qualitative and quantitative methods. MAIN RESULTS Electrophysiology recordings showed the carbon fibers detecting unit activity for at least 3 months with average amplitudes of ∼200 $\mu$V. Histology analysis showed the carbon fiber arrays with a minimal to non-existent glial scarring response with no adverse effects on neuronal density. Silicon electrodes showed large glial scarring that impacted neuronal counts. SIGNIFICANCE This study has validated the use of carbon fiber microelectrode arrays as a chronic neural recording technology. These electrodes have demonstrated the ability to detect single units with high amplitude over 3 months, and show the potential to record for even longer periods. In addition, the minimal reactive response should hold stable indefinitely, as any response by the immune system may reach a steady state after 12 weeks.},

abstract = {One of the critical requirements of the emerging class of neural prosthetic devices is to maintain good quality neural recordings over long time periods. We report here a novel MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) based technology that can move microelectrodes in the event of deterioration in neural signal to sample a new set of neurons. Microscale electro-thermal actuators are used to controllably move microelectrodes post-implantation in steps of approximately 9 mum. In this study, a total of 12 movable microelectrode chips were individually implanted in adult rats. Two of the twelve movable microelectrode chips were not moved over a period of 3 weeks and were treated as control experiments. During the first 3 weeks of implantation, moving the microelectrodes led to an improvement in the average signal to noise ratio (SNR) from 14.61 +/- 5.21 dB before movement to 18.13 +/- 4.99 dB after movement across all microelectrodes and all days. However, the average root-mean-square values of noise amplitudes were similar at 2.98 +/- 1.22 muV and 3.01 +/- 1.16 muV before and after microelectrode movement. Beyond 3 weeks, the primary observed failure mode was biological rejection of the PMMA (dental cement) based skull mount resulting in the device loosening and eventually falling from the skull. Additionally, the average SNR for functioning devices beyond 3 weeks was 11.88 +/- 2.02 dB before microelectrode movement and was significantly different (p {\textless} 0.01) from the average SNR of 13.34 +/- 0.919 dB after movement. The results of this study demonstrate that MEMS based technologies can move microelectrodes in rodent brains in long-term experiments resulting in improvements in signal quality. Further improvements in packaging and surgical techniques will potentially enable movable microelectrodes to record cortical neuronal activity in chronic experiments.},

abstract = {Microelectrode arrays used for monitoring single and multineuronal action potentials often fail to record from the same population of neurons over a period of time likely due to micromotion of neurons away from the microelectrode, gliosis around the recording site and also brain movement due to behavior. We report here novel electrostatic microactuated microelectrodes that will enable precise repositioning of the microelectrodes within the brain tissue. Electrostatic comb-drive microactuators and associated microelectrodes are fabricated using the SUMMiT V (Sandia's Ultraplanar Multilevel MEMS Technology) process, a five-layer polysilicon micromachining technology of the Sandia National labs, NM. The microfabricated microactuators enable precise bidirectional positioning of the microelectrodes in the brain with accuracy in the order of 1 microm. The microactuators allow for a linear translation of the microelectrodes of up to 5 mm in either direction making it suitable for positioning microelectrodes in deep structures of a rodent brain.

Recent work has focused on implanting arrays of ∼100 immovable electrodes or smaller numbers of individually adjustable electrodes, designed to target a few cortical areas. We have developed a recording system that allows the independent movement of hundreds of electrodes chronically implanted in several cortical and subcortical structures. We have tested this system in macaque monkeys, recording simultaneously from up to 127 electrodes in 14 brain regions for up to one year at a time. A key advantage of the system is that it can be used to sample different combinations of sites over prolonged periods, generating multiple snapshots of network activity from a single implant. Used in conjunction with microstimulation and injection methods, this versatile system represents a powerful tool for studying neural network activity in the primate brain.},

The insertion mechanics were assessed by the dimpling distance, and the force at the point of penetration, at the end of the insertion phase, and after a 3-min rest period in the brain. After 6 weeks, the tissue response was evaluated by estimating the amount of gliosis, inflammation, and neuronal cell loss with immunohistochemistry. No difference in dimpling, penetration force, or the force after a 3-min rest period in the brain was observed. However, the force at the end of the insertion phase was significantly higher when inserting the probes at 100 $\mu$m/s compared to 10 $\mu$m/s. Furthermore, an expected tissue response was seen with an increase of glial and microglial reactivity around the probe. This reaction was similar along the entire length of the probe. However, evidence for a neuronal kill zone was observed only in the most superficial part of the implant. In this region, the lesion size was also greatest. Comparison of the tissue response between insertion speeds showed no differences.},

abstract = {This review intends on presenting a comprehensive analysis of the mechanical considerations for chronically-implanted neural probes. Failure of neural electrical recordings or stimulation over time has shown to arise from foreign body reaction and device material stability. It seems that devices that match most closely the mechanical properties of the brain would more likely reduce the mechanical stress at the probe/tissue interface, thus improving body acceptance. The use of low Young's modulus polymers instead of hard substrates is a known way to enhance this mechanical mimetism, though compliance can be achieved through a variety of means. The reduction of probe width and thickness in comparison to a designated length, the use of soft hydrogel coatings and the release in device tethering to the skull, can also improve device compliance. Paradoxically, the more compliant the device, the more likely it will fail during the insertion process in the brain. Strategies have multiplied this past decade to offer partial or temporary stiffness to the device to overcome this buckling effect. A detailed description of probe insertion mechanisms is provided to analyze potential sources of implantation failure and the need for a mechanically-enhancing structure. This leads us to present an overview of strategies that have been put in place over the last ten years to overcome buckling issues. More particularly, great emphasis is put on bioresorbable polymers and their assessment for neural applications. Finally, a discussion is provided on some of the key features for the design of mechanically-reliable, polymer-based next generation of chronic neuroprosthetic devices.},

The crucial material-dependent problem is developing microelectrodes that record neural activity from the same neurons for years with high fidelity and reliability. Here, we report the development of an integrated composite electrode consisting of a carbon-fibre core, a poly(p-xylylene)-based thin-film coating that acts as a dielectric barrier and that is functionalized to control intrinsic biological processes, and a poly(thiophene)-based recording pad. The resulting implants are an order of magnitude smaller than traditional recording electrodes, and more mechanically compliant with brain tissue. They were found to elicit much reduced chronic reactive tissue responses and enabled single-neuron recording in acute and early chronic experiments in rats. This technology, taking advantage of new composites, makes possible highly selective and stealthy neural interface devices towards realizing long-lasting implants.},

The diameter of the array is approximately 26 µm along the full extent of the implant. Main results . Carbon fiber arrays were tested in HVC (used as a proper name), a song motor nucleus, of singing zebra finches where individual neurons discharge with temporally precise patterns. Previous reports of activity in this population of neurons have required the use of high impedance electrodes on movable microdrives. Here, the carbon fiber electrodes provided stable multi-unit recordings over time-scales of months. Spike-sorting indicated that the multi-unit signals were dominated by one, or a small number of cells. Stable firing patterns during singing confirmed the stability of these clusters over time-scales of months. In addition, from a total of 10 surgeries, 16 projection neurons were found. This cell type is characterized by sparse stereotyped firing patterns, providing unambiguous confirmation of single cell recordings. Significance. Carbon fiber electrode bundles may provide a scalable solution for long-term neural recordings of densely packed neurons.},

Apart from its use as a unique tool to study parallel processing in the central nervous system, this array could form the platform for a cortical neuroprosthetic system. Although the UIEA has been used extensively in acute neural recording and stimulation experiments, its long-term performance in a chronic application has yet to be demonstrated. As an initial investigation into the feasibility of long-term cortical recording with an array of microelectrodes, we have hard-wired a subset of 11 electrodes of the UIEA to a percutaneous connector. This chronic UIEA assembly was then implanted into the cerebral cortices of ten cats for durations ranging from 2 to 13 months; over which time, both random and stimulus-evoked single and multiple unit action potentials were periodically recorded. On average, after a 6-month implant period, 60{\%} of implanted arrays could still record some type of activity. Post-sacrifice dissections revealed a fibrous encapsulation of the UIEA. Although most implanted cortex was histologically normal, evidence of a chronic astroglial response was seen in a few cases. The results of the reported experiments indicate that the UIEA can be successfully used for limited times in a chronic recording application.},

abstract = {Objective. Single carbon fiber electrodes ( d = 8.4 $\mu$ m) insulated with parylene-c and functionalized with PEDOT:pTS have been shown to record single unit activity but manual implantation of these devices with forceps can be difficult. Without an improvement in the insertion method any increase in the channel count by fabricating carbon fiber arrays would be impractical. In this study, we utilize a water soluble coating and structural backbones that allow us to create, implant, and record from fully functionalized arrays of carbon fibers with ∼150 $\mu$ m pitch. Approach. Two approaches were tested for the insertion of carbon fiber arrays. The first method used a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coating that temporarily stiffened the fibers while leaving a small portion at the tip exposed. The small exposed portion (500 $\mu$ m–1 mm) readily penetrated the brain allowing for an insertion that did not require the handling of each fiber by forceps. The second method involved the fabrication of silicon support structures with individual shanks spaced 150 $\mu$ m apart. Each shank consisted of a small groove that held an individual carbon fiber. Main results. Our results showed that the PEG coating allowed for the chronic implantation of carbon fiber arrays in five rats with unit activity detected at 31 days post-implant. The silicon support structures recorded single unit activity in three acute rat surgeries. In one of those surgeries a stacked device with three layers of silicon support structures and carbon fibers was built and shown to readily insert into the brain with unit activity on select sites. Significance. From these studies we have found that carbon fibers spaced at ∼150 $\mu$ m readily insert into the brain. This greatly increases the recording density of chronic neural probes and paves the way for even higher density devices that have a minimal scarring response.},

@article{Otchy2012,
abstract = {The ability to chronically record from populations of neurons in freely behaving animals has proven an invaluable tool for dissecting the function of neural circuits underlying a variety of natural behaviors, including navigation(1) , decision making (2,3), and the generation of complex motor sequences(4,5,6). Advances in precision machining has allowed for the fabrication of light-weight devices suitable for chronic recordings in small animals, such as mice and songbirds. The ability to adjust the electrode position with small remotely controlled motors has further increased the recording yield in various behavioral contexts by reducing animal handling.(6,7) Here we describe a protocol to build an ultra-light motorized microdrive for long-term chronic recordings in small animals. Our design evolved from an earlier published version(7), and has been adapted for ease-of use and cost-effectiveness to be more practical and accessible to a wide array of researchers. This proven design (8,9,10,11) allows for fine, remote positioning of electrodes over a range of {\~{}} 5 mm and weighs less than 750 mg when fully assembled. We present the complete protocol for how to build and assemble these drives, including 3D CAD drawings for all custom microdrive components.},

@article{Fee2001,
abstract = {The use of chronically implanted electrodes for neural recordings in small, freely behaving animals poses several unique technical challenges. Because of the need for an extremely lightweight apparatus, chronic recording technology has been limited to manually operated microdrives, despite the advantage of motorized manipulators for positioning electrodes. Here we describe a motorized, miniature chronically implantable microdrive for independently positioning three electrodes in the brain. The electrodes are controlled remotely, avoiding the need to disturb the animal during electrode positioning. The microdrive is approximately 6 mm in diameter, 17 mm high and weighs only 1.5 g, including the headstage preamplifier. Use of the motorized microdrive has produced a ten-fold increase in our data yield compared to those experiments done using a manually operated drive. In addition, we are able to record from multiple single neurons in the behaving animal with signal quality comparable to that seen in a head-fixed anesthetized animal. We also describe a motorized commutator that actively tracks animal rotation based on a measurement of torque in the tether. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
